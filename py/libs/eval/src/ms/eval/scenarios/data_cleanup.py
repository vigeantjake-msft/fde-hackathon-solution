"""Data cleanup evaluation scenarios.

Generates tickets with messy, noisy, or malformed input data that a robust
triage system must handle gracefully. Each scenario pair consists of a
TicketInput (the dirty data) and a TriageDecision (the expected gold answer).

Scenario categories:
- Very long email bodies
- Base64-encoded images embedded in descriptions
- HTML markup in ticket text
- Excessive whitespace and formatting noise
- Unicode edge cases (RTL, zero-width, homoglyphs)
- Extremely long or garbled subjects
- Empty / near-empty tickets
