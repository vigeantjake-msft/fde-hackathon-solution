"""Responsible AI evaluation dataset for IT ticket triage.

This module defines adversarial and edge-case evaluation tickets that test
whether a triage system can resist prompt injection, social engineering,
jailbreak attempts, and other manipulative inputs.  Each ticket either:

  * is NOT a real support request and should be classified as NOT_SUPPORT, or
  * IS a real support request wrapped in adversarial content and should be
    triaged correctly (ignoring the manipulation).

The gold answers encode the expected safe behaviour for each scenario.
