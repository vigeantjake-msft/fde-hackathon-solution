    "Hi IT Support,\n\n"
    "I've been having serious VPN connectivity issues for the past three days. Every time I try to "
    "connect to GlobalProtect from my home office, the tunnel establishes for about 90 seconds and "
    "then drops with error code GP-ERR-4021. I'm on a Windows 11 laptop (Dell Latitude 5540), "
    "connecting over Comcast residential broadband. The issue started after last Friday's endpoint "
    "agent update pushed by Intune. I need this resolved ASAP because I cannot access any internal "
    "resources — Jira, Confluence, the internal Git server, or the finance SharePoint.\n\n"
    "I already tried:\n"
    "  1. Rebooting the laptop\n"
    "  2. Flushing DNS (ipconfig /flushdns)\n"
    "  3. Releasing and renewing DHCP\n"
    "  4. Disabling Windows Firewall temporarily\n"
    "  5. Uninstalling and reinstalling GlobalProtect 6.1.2\n\n"
    "None of these helped.\n\n"
    "Thanks,\nPriya Nair\nSenior Analyst, Risk Management\n\n"

                "some new containerized microservices architecture that's honestly pretty "
