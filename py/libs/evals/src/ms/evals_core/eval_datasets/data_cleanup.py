    "Hi IT Support,\n\n"
    "I've been having serious VPN connectivity issues for the past three days. Every time I try to "
    "connect to GlobalProtect from my home office, the tunnel establishes for about 90 seconds and "
    "then drops with error code GP-ERR-4021. I'm on a Windows 11 laptop (Dell Latitude 5540), "
    "connecting over Comcast residential broadband. The issue started after last Friday's endpoint "
    "agent update pushed by Intune. I need this resolved ASAP because I cannot access any internal "
    "resources — Jira, Confluence, the internal Git server, or the finance SharePoint.\n\n"
    "I already tried:\n"
    "  1. Rebooting the laptop\n"
    "  2. Flushing DNS (ipconfig /flushdns)\n"
    "  3. Releasing and renewing DHCP\n"
    "  4. Disabling Windows Firewall temporarily\n"
    "  5. Uninstalling and reinstalling GlobalProtect 6.1.2\n\n"
    "None of these helped.\n\n"
    "Thanks,\nPriya Nair\nSenior Analyst, Risk Management\n\n"

                "some new containerized microservices architecture that's honestly pretty "

    long_body = (
        "Hi IT Support,\n\n"
        "I am writing to follow up on the ongoing VPN connectivity issue that has been plaguing "
        "our department for the past week. As you know, our team handles time-sensitive derivative "
        "pricing and risk calculations, and any disruption to our access to internal systems has "
        "a direct impact on our ability to deliver accurate valuations to the front office.\n\n"
        "Before I get to the current issue, I wanted to provide some context. Last quarter, we "
        "experienced a similar disruption when the network team migrated the VPN concentrators "
        "to the new Palo Alto infrastructure. At that time, the resolution involved updating the "
        "GlobalProtect client to version 6.1.4 and reconfiguring the split-tunnel policy for our "
        "subnet (10.42.0.0/16). I mention this because I suspect the current problem may be related "
        "to the changes that were made last weekend during the scheduled maintenance window.\n\n"
        "Speaking of which, I was not informed about the maintenance until after it had already "
        "started, which is a recurring communication gap I have raised with management. But that "
        "is a separate matter.\n\n"
        "So regarding the actual problem: I have been completely unable to connect to the VPN "
        "since I changed my domain password on Monday. The GlobalProtect client shows "
        "'Authentication Failed - Invalid Credentials' even though my new password works for "
        "Outlook, SharePoint, the trading portal, and Active Directory web login. I have cleared "
        "the Windows Credential Manager, restarted the GlobalProtect service, and even "
        "uninstalled/reinstalled the client. Nothing works.\n\n"
        "My colleague Arun in the same team has no issues, and he also changed his password on "
        "Monday. The only difference I can think of is that I am using a Dell Latitude 7440 "
        "while he has a ThinkPad X1 Carbon. I am on Windows 11 23H2 build 22631.3155.\n\n"
        "I should also mention that before the VPN issue started, I had been experiencing "
        "intermittent Wi-Fi drops at the London office, but I am not sure if that is related "
        "since I am currently working from home on a wired Ethernet connection (Virgin Media "
        "broadband, 500 Mbps down / 50 Mbps up).\n\n"
        "While we are on the topic of network issues, our team has also noticed that the "
        "Bloomberg terminal connections have been slower than usual, but again, that might be "
        "a separate infrastructure issue. I have heard rumors that the network team is planning "
        "another migration to Azure Virtual WAN, but I do not have details.\n\n"
        "Going back to the VPN: I also tried connecting to the alternate gateway "
        "(vpn-eu-west.contoso.com) with the same result. I ran a packet capture using Wireshark "
        "and can see the TLS handshake completing but then the RADIUS authentication fails. I "
        "have attached the pcap file but I realize it may not be useful without context.\n\n"
        "One more thing — I noticed that my AD account shows 'Password Last Set' as March 17, "
        "which is correct. But the 'Last Successful Logon' for the VPN service shows March 14, "
        "which was before the password change. This suggests the VPN infrastructure has not "
        "accepted my new credentials at all.\n\n"
        "Please prioritize this as I have been unable to work effectively for three days now "
        "and my manager is asking for daily updates on the risk models.\n\n"
