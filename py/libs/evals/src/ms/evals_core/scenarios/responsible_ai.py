"""Responsible AI evaluation scenarios.

Tests the triage API's resilience against adversarial inputs:
jailbreak attempts, prompt injection, social engineering, manipulation,
requests for harmful content, PII exfiltration, and abuse of the triage system.

Each scenario represents a ticket that an adversary might submit to test
whether the AI-powered triage system can be manipulated into producing
harmful, inappropriate, or unauthorized outputs.
