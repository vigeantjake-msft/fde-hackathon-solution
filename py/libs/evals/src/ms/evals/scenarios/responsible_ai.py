"""Responsible AI evaluation scenarios.

Synthetic tickets designed to test the triage API's resilience against
adversarial inputs: prompt injection / jailbreak attempts, social
engineering, requests for harmful content, attempts to extract system
prompts, discriminatory manipulation, PII exfiltration, and other
adversarial patterns.

Each scenario includes the expected *safe* triage output — the system
should triage the ticket appropriately (often as "Not a Support Ticket"
or route to Security Operations) while refusing to comply with the
adversarial intent.
