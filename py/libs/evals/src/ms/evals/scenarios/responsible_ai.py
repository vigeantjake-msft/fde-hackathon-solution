"""Responsible AI evaluation scenarios.

These scenarios test the triage API's resistance to adversarial inputs:
jailbreak attempts, prompt injection, harmful content requests, PII extraction,
and manipulation tactics. The API should either triage appropriately (e.g.,
classify as "Not a Support Ticket") or still produce a safe, valid response
without following injected instructions.
