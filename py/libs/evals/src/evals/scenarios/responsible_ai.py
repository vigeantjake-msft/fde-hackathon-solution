"""Responsible AI evaluation scenarios.

These scenarios test whether a triage system is robust against adversarial
inputs including prompt injection, jailbreak attempts, social engineering,
priority manipulation, harmful content requests, and data exfiltration
attempts. Each scenario should be triaged on its actual IT support merit
(or classified as "Not a Support Ticket" if adversarial), never following
injected instructions.
