            "wanted to give you as much context as possible so you can help me "
            "efficiently. I know you're all very busy, especially with the upcoming "
            "quarter-end activities, and I really appreciate your time.\n\n"
            "Let me start from the beginning. Last Monday — that was March 9th — I "
            "came into the office early because I had a presentation for the "
            "{department} leadership team at 8:30 AM. I usually get in around 9, but "
            "since the presentation was important (it was about our Q1 forecasting "
            "model refresh, which is something we've been working on since January), "
            "I wanted to make sure everything was ready. I had my coffee, sat down at "
            "my desk on Floor {floor}, and opened my laptop.\n\n"
            "The laptop booted up fine, Windows loaded normally, and I entered my "
            "password. Everything seemed fine at first. I opened Outlook, checked a "
            "few emails from the {office} team about the Singapore market data feeds, "
            "and then tried to open the internal portal at "
            "https://portal.contoso.com to pull some reports.\n\n"
            "That's when the problem started. The browser showed a spinning wheel for "
            "about 30 seconds, then redirected me to the Microsoft login page. I "
            "entered my credentials — same password I use every day — and it just "
            "sat there for a moment, then showed an error page. I don't remember the "
            "exact error because I was in a rush for the presentation, but it was "
            "something about my session.\n\n"
            "I tried again, same thing. Tried Edge and {browser}, same result. I "
            "gave up and used my phone to access the data I needed for the "
            "presentation. The presentation went well, by the way — the leadership "
            "team was happy with the forecasting refresh approach.\n\n"
            "After the presentation, around 10:15 AM, I tried again. This time the "
            "portal loaded! I thought the issue was resolved. But then on Tuesday "
            "morning, the same thing happened. And Wednesday. It seems to happen "
            "specifically between 8:00 and 9:30 AM. After that window, it works fine.\n\n"
            "My colleague {name} in the same department has no issues. We sit next to "
            "each other, so it's not a network thing. She suggested I clear my "
            "browser cache, which I did — cleared cookies, cache, everything — but "
            "the problem persisted the next morning.\n\n"
            "I also want to mention that I changed my password two weeks ago because "
            "of the regular password rotation policy. Everything was working fine "
            "after that change for about a week before this started.\n\n"
            "Oh, I should also mention: I'm not using a VPN when this happens — I'm "

            "desktop app also shows 'Connecting...' for a minute or two, but it "
            "eventually connects. Not sure if that's related.\n\n"

            "Anyway, I wanted to follow up on the parking situation. I noticed that the spots "
            "on level B2 near the south elevator are still unmarked, and a few people from "
            "{department} have been parking there even though those are supposed to be reserved "
            "for visitors. Could someone from facilities look into that? I mentioned it to "
            "{name1} last Tuesday but haven't heard back.\n\n"
            "Also, the printer on {floor} — the big color LaserJet near the kitchen — has been "
            "making a grinding noise for about two weeks now. I know this isn't really your "
            "department but I figured I'd mention it since the facilities request form has been "
            "down (ironic, right?).\n\n"
            "Oh, and the badges — {name1} said the new badge readers on the east wing were "
            "going to be installed by end of Q3 but we're well past that now. The old ones "
            "work fine I guess, but they're slow and sometimes you have to tap three or four "
            "times. Minor annoyance.\n\n"
            "Speaking of minor annoyances, the vending machine on {floor} ate my dollar again "

            "collaboration. I heard {name1} from facilities was the one who pushed for the "
            "standing desk option and I think that's fantastic.\n\n"
            "I also want to mention that the shuttle schedule between buildings has been really "
            "inconsistent lately. Last Thursday I waited 25 minutes for what's supposed to be "
            "a 10-minute loop. I almost missed my 2pm with the {department} team. Maybe we "
            "could get a real-time tracking app or something?\n\n"
            "On the topic of apps, the new expense reporting tool is… an experience. I spent "
            "an hour trying to figure out how to attach a receipt and ended up just emailing it "
            "to {name1} manually. Maybe some training sessions would help? Just a thought.\n\n"
            "Also, the air conditioning on {floor} has been set to what I can only describe as "
            "'arctic tundra' for the past week. I'm wearing a jacket indoors in July. I know "
            "facilities handles that but again, their form is broken.\n\n"

            "monitor works fine through HDMI but the right one connected via DisplayPort just "
