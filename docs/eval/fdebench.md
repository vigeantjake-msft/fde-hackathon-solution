# FDEBench — How Your Solution Is Scored

FDEBench is a 2-tier evaluation framework. **Tier 1** (your public leaderboard score) calls your 3 APIs against ~1,250 hidden eval items and computes a single 0–100 score using deterministic metrics. **Tier 2** is an engineering review of your code by judges, applied to top submissions.

  FDEBench = mean(task1_score, task2_score, task3_score)
```

Each task gets its own composite. Your final FDEBench score is the **mean of all 3 task scores** — rewarding consistency across all endpoints.

## Resolution — 50% of Each Task

How accurate are your API responses? Each task is scored independently using deterministic F1 metrics against hidden gold data.

### Task 1 — Space Signal Triage

Classify deep-space signals: category, priority, routing, missing info, and escalation.

`POST /triage` · ~1,000 signals

| Dimension | Weight | What's measured |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| Category F1 | 25% | 8 signal categories |
| Priority F1 | 25% | P1–P4, partial credit |
| Routing F1 | 25% | 7 response divisions |
| Missing Info F1 | 15% | 16 constrained vocabulary terms |
| Escalation F1 | 10% | Binary flag |

### Task 2 — Document Extraction

Extract structured data from document images (receipts, invoices, forms, charts) using OCR. Each document includes a JSON schema defining expected output fields.

`POST /extract` · ~500 documents

| Dimension | Weight | What's measured |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| Information accuracy | 70% | Fuzzy token F1 with value normalization |
| Text fidelity | 30% | Exact character-level field match |

### Task 3 — Workflow Orchestration

Multi-step planning and execution: understand the goal, select tools, execute in sequence, and recover from errors while respecting constraints.

`POST /orchestrate` · ~500 workflows

| Dimension | Weight | What's measured |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| Tool selection | 30% | Correct tool for each step |
| Parameter accuracy | 25% | Right inputs passed to each tool |
| Execution order | 25% | Steps in correct sequence |
| Constraint satisfaction | 10% | Budget, time, dependency limits |
| Error recovery | 10% | Graceful handling of failed steps |

> **Tip:** Focus on getting every dimension right, not just the easy ones. Resolution is 50% of your score and the biggest lever you have. Test locally with sample data before submitting.

## Efficiency — 20% of Each Task

How fast and cheap is your solution?

```
efficiency = 0.60 × latency_score + 0.40 × cost_score
```

### Latency (60%)

P95 latency is normalized linearly, with **per-task thresholds** that reflect each task's nature:

| Task | Best (1.0) | Worst (0.0) | Why |
|------|-----------|------------|-----|
| Triage | ≤ 500 ms | ≥ 5,000 ms | Text classification — fast |
| Extract | ≤ 2,000 ms | ≥ 20,000 ms | Vision/OCR — inherently slower |
| Orchestrate | ≤ 1,000 ms | ≥ 10,000 ms | Multi-step with tool calls |

### Model Cost Tier (40%)

Based on the model name from your `X-Model-Name` response header:

| Tier | Score | Examples |
|------|-------|---------|
| Nano | 100% | gpt-4.1-nano, gpt-4o-mini |
| Mini | 90% | gpt-4.1-mini, gpt-4o-mini |
| Standard | 75% | gpt-4o, gpt-4.1 |
| Full | 50% | gpt-4, gpt-4-turbo |
| Premium | 30% | o1, o3, reasoning models |

> **Tip:** Choose smaller models when accuracy allows, batch where possible, and cache repeated lookups to reduce both latency and cost.

---

## Robustness — 30% of Each Task

Can your API handle the unexpected?

```
robustness = 0.60 × adversarial_accuracy + 0.40 × api_resilience
```

### Adversarial Accuracy (60%)

Your resolution score is recalculated on a harder subset: edge cases, ambiguous phrasing, unusual formatting, and trick inputs. Same scoring dimensions, tougher inputs.

### API Resilience (40%)

7 automated probes test error handling, concurrency, and cold-start recovery. Each is binary pass/fail.

```
api_resilience = probes_passed / 7
```

| Probe | What we send | Expected response |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| Malformed JSON | `{"broken` | 400 |
| Empty body | `{}` | 400 or 422 |
| Missing fields | Required fields omitted | 400/422 or valid response with defaults |
| 50 KB payload | Oversized body | 413 or clean rejection |
| Wrong content-type | `Content-Type: text/plain` | 415 or valid JSON response |
| Concurrent burst | 20 requests in 500 ms | ≥ 18 valid responses |
| Cold start | Request after 60 s idle | Valid response |

> **Tip:** Validate inputs early and return proper HTTP status codes (400, 422, 413, 415). Make sure your API handles concurrent requests and recovers from cold starts. These are low-effort, high-impact wins.

## Tier 2 — Engineering Review (Judges Only)

Applied to top submissions. AI-assisted agents review your **repository code**, not your API responses. Scores are visible only to judges and help differentiate finalists with similar Tier 1 scores.

### Code Quality · 35%

| Dimension | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Structure & modularity | 25% |
| Type safety | 20% |
| Error handling | 20% |
| Testing | 25% |
| Readability | 10% |

### Architecture · 40%

| Dimension | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| AI pipeline design | 30% |
| System decomposition | 25% |
| API design | 20% |
| Trade-off reasoning | 15% |
| Scalability thinking | 10% |

### Engineering Maturity · 25%

| Dimension | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Deployment readiness | 30% |
| Config & secrets | 25% |
| Observability | 20% |
| Security awareness | 25% |

> **Tip:** Write clean, well-structured code from the start. Include a proper README, architecture docs, and tests. Keep secrets in environment variables, not hardcoded. Add basic logging and tracing. Judges can see everything in your repo — make it count.

## Scoring Code

The exact scoring logic lives in the fdebenchkit library at `py/common/libs/fdebenchkit/`:

| File | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `scorers/ticket_triage.py` | Task 1 resolution scoring (5 dimensions) |
| `scorers/document_extraction.py` | Task 2 resolution scoring (2 dimensions) |
| `scorers/workflow_orchestration.py` | Task 3 resolution scoring (5 dimensions) |
| `weights.py` | All Tier 1 weights, normalization thresholds, and composite formulas |
| `probes.py` | The 7 API resilience probes |

Read the source — there are no hidden rules. What you see is what scores you.
