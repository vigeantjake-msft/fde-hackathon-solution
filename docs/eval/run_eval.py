"""🛰️ CONTOSO DEEP SPACE STATION — SCORING COMPUTER 🛰️
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

    "The scoring computer doesn't care about your feelings.
     It doesn't care about your excuses. It doesn't care that
     the LLM was 'pretty close.' Space doesn't grade on a curve."
                                        — Admiral Chen, CDSS

Evaluation harness for Signal Triage — the same cold, unforgiving
math the platform uses to score your submission. Run it locally.
See exactly how you'll be scored. No surprises on launch day.

Usage:
    uv run python run_eval.py \\
        --endpoint http://localhost:8000 \\
        --dataset ../data/signals/sample.json \\
        --gold ../data/signals/sample_gold.json

Architecture:
    The scoring computer evaluates your submission on 7 dimensions:

    5 classification dimensions (max 85 pts total):
        0.20 × category      — macro F1 across 8 anomaly categories
        0.20 × priority      — mean ordinal partial credit (P1–P4)
        0.20 × routing       — macro F1 across 7 response divisions
        0.15 × missing_info  — mean per-signal set F1
        0.10 × escalation    — binary F1 on the positive class

    2 efficiency dimensions (max 15 pts total):
        0.10 × latency       — normalized p50 response time
        0.05 × cost          — normalized $/signal from token usage

    Total = classification (0–85) + efficiency (0–15) = 0–100.

    Why macro F1 instead of accuracy:
        Accuracy is gameable — always predicting the most common class
        gets you high accuracy while the crew dies from an unrouted hull
        breach. Macro F1 computes F1 per class then averages, so every
        anomaly type matters equally. A system that ignores rare-but-critical
        classes (e.g., "Threat Detection & Containment") gets a score as
        cold as the void outside.

    On the leaderboard this counts as 50% of the final 0-100 score.
    The other 50% comes from engineering quality (evaluated after submission).

    Note: remediation_steps and next_best_action are still required in
    your API response (they are part of the output schema), but they are
    not deterministically scored. Quality of remediation is evaluated as
    part of the engineering quality assessment — because a system that says
    "investigate the anomaly" for every signal is telling us you phoned it
    in from a comfortable 1 AU away.

    Efficiency scoring: To participate in latency and cost scoring, your
    API should return these response headers:
        X-Model-Name:         model name (e.g., "gpt-4o-mini")
        X-Prompt-Tokens:      integer token count
        X-Completion-Tokens:  integer token count
    These are optional — missing headers result in worst-case cost scoring.
    (As if you're burning GPT-4 with zero caching. The Admiral will have
    questions about your fuel budget.)
