# Eval Harness

🛰️ **CDSS SCORING COMPUTER — SELF-SERVICE TERMINAL** 🛰️

This is the same scoring logic the platform uses. Run it locally, see exactly how you'll be scored. No surprises on launch day. The only acceptable surprise in space is a birthday party, and even those need to be cleared with ops.

> **What this scores:** The 5 classification dimensions (up to 85 pts).
> **What it doesn't score:** Efficiency (latency + cost) and the separate engineering review. Those happen after you submit. The scoring computer is cold, unforgiving math — like the vacuum outside the viewport.

## Quick Start

```bash
cd docs/eval

# Score against the 25 sample signals (with gold answers)
uv run python run_eval.py \
  --endpoint http://localhost:8000 \
  --dataset ../data/signals/sample.json \
  --gold ../data/signals/sample_gold.json
```

## How Scoring Works

Full details in the [challenge README](../challenge/README.md#how-we-score-you). Here's the mission briefing version.

### Your functional score (0–100)

```
functional = classification (0–85) + efficiency (0–15)
```

The local eval harness computes the **classification** portion. The platform adds efficiency after calling your live endpoint — because we time your triage decisions with the same ruthlessness as a countdown clock.

### Classification dimensions (what this harness scores)

| Dimension | Weight | Metric | Scoring logic |
|---|---|---|---|
| `category` | 20% | **Macro F1** | Per-class F1, averaged across 8 anomaly categories |
| `priority` | 20% | **Mean partial credit** | Exact = 1.0, off-by-one = 0.67, off-by-two+ = 0.0 |
| `routing` | 20% | **Macro F1** | Per-class F1, averaged across 7 response divisions |
| `missing_info` | 15% | **Mean set F1** | Per-signal F1 on constrained vocabulary, then averaged |
| `escalation` | 10% | **Binary F1** | F1 for the positive class across all signals |

The classification score is:

```
weighted = 0.20×category + 0.20×priority + 0.20×routing + 0.15×missing_info + 0.10×escalation
classification_pts = (weighted / 0.85) × 85  →  range [0, 85]
```

### Efficiency dimensions (scored by the platform, not this harness)

| Dimension | Weight | Best (1.0) | Worst (0.0) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Latency | 10% | p50 ≤ 200ms | p50 ≥ 2000ms |
| Cost | 5% | ≤ $0.001/signal | ≥ $0.05/signal |

The harness shows latency stats so you can keep an eye on your fuel consumption, but doesn't fold them into the score.

### Priority partial credit

You get credit for being close, but only one level off. Two or more? Zero. Space doesn't grade on a curve.

| Pred \ Gold | P1 | P2 | P3 | P4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **P1** | 1.00 | 0.67 | 0.00 | 0.00 |
| **P2** | 0.67 | 1.00 | 0.67 | 0.00 |
| **P3** | 0.00 | 0.67 | 1.00 | 0.67 |
| **P4** | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.67 | 1.00 |

### Missing info set F1

Exact string match on the 16-value vocabulary from the [output schema](../data/schemas/output.json). No fuzzy matching, no synonyms. If you return `"anomaly_reading"` instead of `"anomaly_readout"`, that's a miss.

```
precision = |pred ∩ gold| / |pred|
recall    = |pred ∩ gold| / |gold|
F1        = 2 × precision × recall / (precision + recall)

Both empty → 1.0 (correctly identified nothing is missing — well done, operator)
One empty  → 0.0 (either all false positives or all false negatives)
```

### Boolean coercion

Crew members return weird stuff from APIs. The scoring computer has seen things. `"true"` as a string. `1` as an integer. `"yes"` as if it's having a conversation. The harness handles the common ones so you don't get penalized for returning `"true"` instead of `true`:
- String `"true"` / `"false"` → boolean (Python's `bool("false")` is `True` — a cosmic trap that has claimed more victims than the airlock on Deck 3)
- String `"1"` / `"0"` → boolean
- String `"yes"` / `"no"` → boolean (the scoring computer respects the classics)
- Integer `1` / `0` → boolean
- `None` → `False`
- Literally anything else → `False` (the scoring computer doesn't negotiate)

### What about remediation?

`next_best_action` and `remediation_steps` must be in your response (the schema requires them), but the harness doesn't score them. We look at those when we review your repo. A system that says "investigate the anomaly" for every signal is telling us you phoned it in from a comfortable 1 AU away. Write remediation steps a Tier 1 controller could actually follow while alarm klaxons are blaring and the Admiral is making pointed remarks about "that AI system I was told would fix everything."

## Usage

### 25 sample signals (with gold answers)

This is your main dev loop. Run it early, run it often. The scoring computer never sleeps. Neither should your test pipeline.

```bash
cd docs/eval
uv run python run_eval.py \
  --endpoint http://localhost:8000 \
  --dataset ../data/signals/sample.json \
  --gold ../data/signals/sample_gold.json
```

### 100 public eval signals (no gold answers)

Run this before you submit. There's no gold file so you won't get a score, but it'll catch crashes, timeouts, and schema issues on signals you haven't seen. Think of it as a pre-flight check. You wouldn't launch without one. You shouldn't submit without one either.

```bash
cd docs/eval
uv run python run_eval.py \
  --endpoint http://localhost:8000 \
  --dataset ../data/signals/public_eval.json
```

### Custom gold file

```bash
uv run python run_eval.py \
  --endpoint http://localhost:8000 \
  --dataset path/to/signals.json \
  --gold path/to/gold.json
```

## Sample Output

Each signal shows its per-signal classification score (max 85 pts):

## Running the Tests

The scoring functions have their own test suite (84 tests covering every edge case the void could conceivably throw at a triage system — the scoring computer's self-diagnostics, if you will). Run them if you want to understand exactly how scoring works, or if you've been poking at the harness code, or if you just enjoy watching 84 green checkmarks cascade down your terminal like stars outside the viewport:

```bash
cd docs/eval
python test_scoring.py
```

All 84 should pass. If they don't, something's wrong with your environment, not the tests. The scoring computer has been tested more thoroughly than your station's life support. Probably. (Lt. Mehta would like the record to reflect that he has *also* tested life support. Recently. After an incident.)
