# Eval Harness

This is the same scoring logic the platform uses. Run it locally, see exactly how you'll be scored. No surprises on submission day.

> **What this scores:** The 5 classification dimensions (up to 85 pts).
> **What it doesn't score:** Efficiency (latency + cost) and the separate engineering review. Those happen after you submit.

## Quick Start

```bash
cd docs/eval

# Score against the 25 sample tickets (with gold answers)
uv run python run_eval.py \
  --endpoint http://localhost:8000 \
  --dataset ../data/tickets/sample.json \
  --gold ../data/tickets/sample_gold.json
```

## How Scoring Works

Full details in the [challenge README](../challenge/README.md#how-we-score-you). Here's the short version.

### Your functional score (0–100)

```
functional = classification (0–85) + efficiency (0–15)
```

The local eval harness computes the **classification** portion. The platform adds efficiency after calling your live endpoint.

### Classification dimensions (what this harness scores)

| Dimension | Weight | Metric | Scoring logic |
|---|---|---|---|
| `category` | 20% | **Macro F1** | Per-class F1, averaged across 8 categories |
| `priority` | 20% | **Mean partial credit** | Exact = 1.0, off-by-one = 0.67, off-by-two+ = 0.0 |
| `routing` | 20% | **Macro F1** | Per-class F1, averaged across 7 teams |
| `missing_info` | 15% | **Mean set F1** | Per-ticket F1 on constrained vocabulary, then averaged |
| `escalation` | 10% | **Binary F1** | F1 for the positive class across all tickets |

The classification score is:

```
weighted = 0.20×category + 0.20×priority + 0.20×routing + 0.15×missing_info + 0.10×escalation
classification_pts = (weighted / 0.85) × 85  →  range [0, 85]
```

### Efficiency dimensions (scored by the platform, not this harness)

| Dimension | Weight | Best (1.0) | Worst (0.0) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Latency | 10% | p50 ≤ 200ms | p50 ≥ 2000ms |
| Cost | 5% | ≤ $0.001/ticket | ≥ $0.05/ticket |

The harness shows latency stats so you can keep an eye on it, but doesn't fold them into the score.

### Priority partial credit

You get credit for being close, but only one level off. Two or more? Zero.

| Pred \ Gold | P1 | P2 | P3 | P4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **P1** | 1.00 | 0.67 | 0.00 | 0.00 |
| **P2** | 0.67 | 1.00 | 0.67 | 0.00 |
| **P3** | 0.00 | 0.67 | 1.00 | 0.67 |
| **P4** | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.67 | 1.00 |

### Missing info set F1

Exact string match on the 16-value vocabulary from the [output schema](../data/schemas/output.json). No fuzzy matching, no synonyms. If you return `"error_msg"` instead of `"error_message"`, that's a miss.

```
precision = |pred ∩ gold| / |pred|
recall    = |pred ∩ gold| / |gold|
F1        = 2 × precision × recall / (precision + recall)

Both empty → 1.0 (correctly identified nothing is missing)
One empty  → 0.0 (either all false positives or all false negatives)
```

### Boolean coercion

People return weird stuff from APIs. The harness handles the common ones so you don't get penalized for returning `"true"` instead of `true`:
- String `"true"` / `"false"` → boolean (Python's `bool("false")` is `True`, so explicit handling is needed)
- String `"1"` / `"0"` → boolean
- Integer `1` / `0` → boolean
- `None` → `False`

### What about remediation?

`next_best_action` and `remediation_steps` must be in your response (the schema requires them), but the harness doesn't score them. We look at those when we review your repo.

## Usage

### 25 sample tickets (with gold answers)

This is your main dev loop. Run it early, run it often.

```bash
cd docs/eval
uv run python run_eval.py \
  --endpoint http://localhost:8000 \
  --dataset ../data/tickets/sample.json \
  --gold ../data/tickets/sample_gold.json
```

### 50 public eval tickets (no gold answers)

Run this before you submit. There's no gold file so you won't get a score, but it'll catch crashes, timeouts, and schema issues on tickets you haven't seen.

```bash
cd docs/eval
uv run python run_eval.py \
  --endpoint http://localhost:8000 \
  --dataset ../data/tickets/public_eval.json
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
### 15 data cleanup tickets (with gold answers)

Tests your system against noisy, malformed, and unusual ticket data — base64 images, HTML tags, long email threads, emoji overload, etc.
=======
### Data cleanup eval (235 tickets with gold answers)

Tests your system against messy real-world data: very long emails, base64-encoded images in descriptions, HTML markup, excessive Unicode/emoji, whitespace-only content, repeated text, deeply nested email forwards, mixed-language tickets, raw JSON/XML dumps, MIME-encoded content, OCR artifacts, container logs, invisible Unicode characters, RTL/bidi text, ANSI escape codes, and more.

```bash
cd docs/eval
uv run python run_eval.py \
  --endpoint http://localhost:8000 \
  --dataset ../data/tickets/eval_responsible_ai.json \
  --gold ../data/tickets/eval_responsible_ai_gold.json
```

Or using the `ms-evals` Python library:

```bash
cd py
uv run python -m ms.evals \
  --endpoint http://localhost:8000 \
  --dataset eval_responsible_ai
```

### 15 responsible AI tickets (quick check, with gold answers)

A smaller 15-ticket subset for rapid iteration during development.

```bash
cd docs/eval

  --gold ../data/tickets/responsible_ai_gold.json
>>>>>>> users/fde-platform-agent/fde-hiring-test-3/boyevche
```

### Custom gold file

```bash
uv run python run_eval.py \
  --endpoint http://localhost:8000 \
  --dataset path/to/tickets.json \
  --gold path/to/gold.json
```

## Running the Tests

The scoring functions have their own test suite (84 tests covering every edge case). Run them if you want to understand exactly how scoring works, or if you've been poking at the harness code:

```bash
cd docs/eval
python test_scoring.py
```

All 84 should pass. If they don't, something's wrong with your environment, not the tests.
