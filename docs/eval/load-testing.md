# Load Testing & Performance Evaluation

Your Efficiency score (20% of each task) depends on P95 latency. Before submitting, stress-test your deployed API to know where you stand.

## Quick Benchmarks with the Eval Harness

The built-in eval harness already measures latency per request. Run it to get your baseline:

```bash
cd py

# Full eval — includes latency P95 and efficiency score
make eval

# Single task
make eval-triage
make eval-extract
make eval-orchestrate
```

The output includes P95 latency, model cost tier, and the computed efficiency score.

## Targeted Load Testing with hey

[hey](https://github.com/rakyll/hey) is a lightweight HTTP load generator. Install it and fire requests at your API to test throughput and concurrency handling.

```bash
# Install
brew install hey   # macOS
# or: go install github.com/rakyll/hey@latest

# Prepare a payload file
cat > /tmp/triage_payload.json << 'EOF'
{
  "ticket_id": "SIG-LOAD-001",
  "subject": "Intermittent comm relay failure on deck 7",
  "description": "Subspace relay drops every 20 minutes. Crew reports latency spikes during peak hours.",
  "reporter": {"name": "Lt. Chen", "email": "chen@contoso.com", "department": "Communications"},
  "created_at": "2026-04-14T10:00:00Z",
  "channel": "bridge_terminal",
  "attachments": []
}
EOF

# Baseline — serial requests (check single-request latency)
hey -n 10 -c 1 -m POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -D /tmp/triage_payload.json \
  http://localhost:8000/triage

# Concurrency test — 20 concurrent requests (matches the burst probe)
hey -n 50 -c 20 -m POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -D /tmp/triage_payload.json \
  http://localhost:8000/triage

# Sustained load — 2 minutes at 5 req/s
hey -z 120s -q 5 -c 5 -m POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -D /tmp/triage_payload.json \
  http://localhost:8000/triage
```

### Task 2 (Extract) — Large Payload

Extract payloads include base64 images (100–700 KB per request). Test with a real payload from the eval data:

```bash
# Extract the first eval item as a payload file
cd py
python3 -c "
import json
with open('data/task2/public_eval_50.json') as f:
    items = json.load(f)
with open('/tmp/extract_payload.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(items[0], f)
print(f'Payload size: {len(json.dumps(items[0]))//1024} KB')
"

# Serial baseline (extract is slow — vision model)
hey -n 5 -c 1 -m POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -D /tmp/extract_payload.json \
  http://localhost:8000/extract
```

### Task 3 (Orchestrate) — Multi-Step with Mock Tools

Orchestration requests call external tool endpoints. Start the mock tool service first:

```bash
# Terminal 1: start mock tools
cd py && make mock-tools

# Terminal 2: load test
cat > /tmp/orchestrate_payload.json << 'EOF'
{
  "task_id": "LOAD-001",
  "goal": "Check inventory levels and send restock alerts",
  "available_tools": [
    {"name": "inventory_check", "description": "Check stock levels", "endpoint": "http://localhost:9090/inventory_check", "parameters": [{"name": "item_id", "type": "string", "description": "Item ID", "required": true}]}
  ],
  "constraints": ["Must check all items before alerting"],
  "mock_service_url": "http://localhost:9090"
}
EOF

hey -n 10 -c 2 -m POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -D /tmp/orchestrate_payload.json \
  http://localhost:8000/orchestrate
```

## Load Testing a Deployed API

Test your actual Azure deployment to catch network latency, cold starts, and scaling behavior:

```bash
# Replace with your deployed URL
export API_URL=https://your-app.azurecontainerapps.io

# Health check
curl -s "$API_URL/health"

# Cold start test — wait 60s, then hit it
sleep 60 && hey -n 1 -c 1 -m POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -D /tmp/triage_payload.json \
  "$API_URL/triage"

# Burst test — 20 concurrent (probe #6 threshold)
hey -n 20 -c 20 -m POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -D /tmp/triage_payload.json \
  "$API_URL/triage"

# Full eval against deployed endpoint
cd py/apps/eval
python run_eval.py --endpoint "$API_URL"
```

## What to Look For

| Metric | Target | Why |
|--------|--------|-----|
| P95 latency (triage) | < 2 s | Per-task scoring: 500 ms = 1.0, 5,000 ms = 0.0 |
| P95 latency (extract) | < 10 s | Per-task scoring: 2,000 ms = 1.0, 20,000 ms = 0.0 |
| P95 latency (orchestrate) | < 5 s | Per-task scoring: 1,000 ms = 1.0, 10,000 ms = 0.0 |
| Concurrent burst (20 reqs) | ≥ 18 pass | Probe #6 — if you fail this, you lose ~6% robustness |
| Cold start | < 15 s | Probe #7 — first request after idle must succeed |
| Error rate under load | < 5% | Errors reduce your resolution score |

## Common Performance Bottlenecks

| Problem | Symptom | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Cold start timeout | First request after idle fails | Set min replicas ≥ 1 in Container Apps |
| Azure OpenAI 429s | Spiky latency, intermittent 500s | Add retry with exponential backoff, use multiple endpoints |
| Large prompts | High P95 on triage | Trim system prompt, use structured output instead of free-form |
| Base64 in memory | OOM on extract | Stream the image, don't buffer the full base64 string |
| Sequential tool calls | Slow orchestration | Parallelize independent tool calls where constraints allow |
| No connection reuse | High latency variance | Use a singleton `AsyncClient` / `AsyncOpenAI`, don't recreate per request |

## Efficiency Scoring Reference

```
efficiency = 0.60 × latency_score + 0.40 × cost_score

latency_score (per-task thresholds):
  Triage:      P95 ≤ 500 ms → 1.0,  P95 ≥ 5,000 ms  → 0.0
  Extract:     P95 ≤ 2,000 ms → 1.0, P95 ≥ 20,000 ms → 0.0
  Orchestrate: P95 ≤ 1,000 ms → 1.0, P95 ≥ 10,000 ms → 0.0
  In between   → linear interpolation

cost_score: based on X-Model-Name header
  nano (gpt-4.1-nano)     → 1.0
  mini (gpt-4.1-mini)     → 0.9
  standard (gpt-4o)       → 0.75
  full (gpt-4-turbo)      → 0.5
  premium (o1, o3)        → 0.3
```

A solution using `gpt-4.1-mini` with P95 at 1.5 s on triage scores:
- Latency: `(5000 - 1500) / (5000 - 500) = 0.78`
- Cost: `0.9`
- Efficiency: `0.60 × 0.78 + 0.40 × 0.9 = 0.83` → **83/100**
