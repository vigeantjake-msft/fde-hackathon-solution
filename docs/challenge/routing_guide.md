## How to use this protocol

When a signal comes in, identify the **issue type** from the table below and route to the listed **owning team**. If you're unsure, escalate to the Operations Desk Lead.

## Priority Definitions

| Priority | Label | Response SLA | Resolution SLA | When to use |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | Critical / Red Alert | 15 min | 4 hours | Hull breach, life support failure, hostile contact, commander-impacting |
| P2 | High | 1 hour | 8 hours | Major system malfunction, no workaround, multiple crew affected |
| P3 | Medium | 4 hours | 3 business days | Issue with workaround available, single crew member blocked but non-urgent |
| P4 | Low | 1 business day | 10 business days | Minor inconvenience, cosmetic issue, feature request, general question |

**Override rule:** Any signal mentioning containment breach, hostile contact, or classified data exposure is automatically **P1** regardless of other factors.

## Routing Table

### Crew Identity & Airlock Control

| Anomaly type | Route to | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Biometric reset | Crew Identity & Airlock Control | Self-service terminal handles most; only escalate if self-service fails |
| Crew lockout | Crew Identity & Airlock Control | Check for brute-force indicators first — if suspicious, also alert Threat Response Command |
| New crew provisioning | Crew Identity & Airlock Control | Requires commanding officer approval |
| SSO failures | Crew Identity & Airlock Control | Verify the system is registered in the identity core first |
| Identity core sync | Crew Identity & Airlock Control | Usually related to profile replication across modules |
| Service account requests | Crew Identity & Airlock Control | Requires security review before provisioning |

### Spacecraft Systems Engineering

| Anomaly type | Route to | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Hull damage | Spacecraft Systems Engineering | Assess severity immediately — potential P1 if breach detected |
| Life support malfunction | Spacecraft Systems Engineering | Automatic P1 if atmospheric systems affected |
| Fabricator issues | Spacecraft Systems Engineering | Check if it's a networked fabricator (→ Deep Space Communications) or local |
| Console hardware failure | Spacecraft Systems Engineering | If under warranty, initiate vendor RMA |
| Structural integrity | Spacecraft Systems Engineering | Run structural diagnostics first |
| EVA suit issues | Spacecraft Systems Engineering | Station-maintained suits only |

### Deep Space Communications

| Anomaly type | Route to | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Subspace relay | Deep Space Communications | Check if crew member's credentials are expired first (→ Crew Identity & Airlock Control if so) |
| Comm array alignment | Deep Space Communications | — |
| Navigation beacon | Deep Space Communications | — |
| Antenna interference | Deep Space Communications | Requires security approval from Threat Response Command if jamming suspected |
| Bandwidth / latency | Deep Space Communications | Get specific times and affected services |
| Sensor calibration | Deep Space Communications | If it's a software-specific issue, try Mission Software Operations first |

### Mission Software Operations

| Anomaly type | Route to | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Flight planning errors | Mission Software Operations | — |
| Nav computer issues | Mission Software Operations | Physical hardware issues go to Spacecraft Systems Engineering |
| Science instrument software | Mission Software Operations | — |
| Mission app licensing | Mission Software Operations | Licensing issues specifically — general system outages are Deep Space Communications |
| Internal system bugs | Mission Software Operations | — |

### Threat Response Command

| Anomaly type | Route to | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Hostile contact detected | Threat Response Command | Log contact signature and alert command staff immediately |
| Containment breach | Threat Response Command | Isolate affected section from station network immediately — mandatory P1 |
| Unauthorized access | Threat Response Command | Mandatory P1 escalation |
| Security protocol violations | Threat Response Command | — |
| Spoofed transmissions | Threat Response Command | — |

### Telemetry & Data Core

| Anomaly type | Route to | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Data bank access | Telemetry & Data Core | Requires data owner approval |
| Sensor archive sync | Telemetry & Data Core | Large data sync problems are common; check capacity limits |
| Telemetry pipeline failures | Telemetry & Data Core | — |
| Backup / restore request | Telemetry & Data Core | — |
| Data link access | Telemetry & Data Core | Legacy data links only; new requests should use primary data banks |

## Known gaps in this protocol

> **Raj's note:** The following areas still need to be sorted out. For now, use your best judgment or escalate to the Operations Desk Lead.

- **Biometric issues** — Could be Crew Identity & Airlock Control (crew profile setup), Threat Response Command (policy enforcement / intruder detection), or Spacecraft Systems Engineering (biometric scanner hardware). We haven't agreed on a single owner.
- **Comms quality issues** — Is it a Deep Space Communications issue (signal quality), Mission Software Operations issue (software crash), or Spacecraft Systems Engineering issue (hardware)? Depends on the symptoms.
- **Cloud compute requests** — Orbital compute access, VM requests, etc. Telemetry & Data Core handles some, but we don't have a formal compute ops division yet.
- **Crew onboarding / offboarding** — Touches Crew Identity & Airlock Control (profiles), Spacecraft Systems Engineering (equipment), Mission Software Operations (licenses), and Telemetry & Data Core (access). There's a workflow for this but it's manual and breaks constantly.
- **Fabricators** — Networked fabricators are Deep Space Communications, local fabricators are Spacecraft Systems Engineering, scan-to-comms failures could be either.

## Escalation rules

1. **P1 signals** — Must be acknowledged within 15 minutes. If the assigned team doesn't acknowledge, auto-escalate to Operations Desk Lead.
2. **Security incidents** — Always route to Threat Response Command. If it also affects another team's domain (e.g., compromised crew credentials = Crew Identity & Airlock Control + Threat Response Command), route to Threat Response Command as primary and Crew Identity & Airlock Control as secondary.
3. **VIP / Command signals** — Admiral and Commander-level signals are auto-flagged. Treat as one priority level higher than normal assessment.
4. **Repeat signals** — If the same reporter has filed 3+ signals in 7 days for the same issue, escalate to the team lead for root cause investigation.
