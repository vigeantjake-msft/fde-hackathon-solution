# CDSS Mission Ops — Internal Signal Routing Guide

> **Last updated:** July 2025
> **Author:** Chief Signal Officer Raj Mehta
> **Status:** DRAFT — some sections still being finalized after the Q2 crew rotation. If you were expecting a polished document, I regret to inform you that we had a containment breach in Exobiology during the reorg and three cat specimens escaped. We caught two. The third one adapted. It's a long story.

## How to use this guide

When a signal comes in, identify the **issue type** from the table below and route to the listed **owning team**. If you're unsure, escalate to the Chief Signal Officer (that's me, and I will judge you, but at least the signal won't kill anyone).

## Priority Definitions

| Priority | Label | Response SLA | Resolution SLA | When to use |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | 🔴 Red Alert | 15 min | 4 hours | Hull breach, hostile contact in progress, life support failure, command-level emergency |
| P2 | 🟠 Yellow Alert | 1 hour | 8 hours | Major system failure, no workaround, multiple crew affected |
| P3 | 🔵 Standard Ops | 4 hours | 3 cycles | Impact with workaround available, single crew member affected but non-urgent |
| P4 | 🟢 Routine | 1 cycle | 10 cycles | Minor annoyance, cosmetic issue, feature request, general question |

**Override rule:** Any signal mentioning potential hull breach, atmospheric compromise, or containment failure is automatically **P1** regardless of other factors. I don't care if it's phrased politely. I don't care if it says "no rush." If the word "decompression" appears anywhere in the signal, it's a Red Alert. We learned this the hard way. See: Deck 4 corridor incident, January 2026.

## Routing Table

### Crew Identity & Airlock Control

| Issue type | Route to | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Biometric reset | Crew Identity & Airlock Control | Self-service kiosk handles most; only escalate if biometric recalibration fails |
| Account lockout | Crew Identity & Airlock Control | Check for brute-force indicators first — if suspicious, also alert Threat Response. *Mehta's note: Three lockouts from the same airlock in one shift is not a coincidence. It's either a break-in attempt or Ensign Torres forgetting his clearance code again. Either way, flag it.* |
| New crew provisioning | Crew Identity & Airlock Control | Requires section chief approval via bridge terminal |
| SSO not working | Crew Identity & Airlock Control | Verify the system is registered in the BioScan ID directory first |
| Directory sync issues | Crew Identity & Airlock Control | Usually BioScan ID replication lag — check the sync queue before panicking |
| Service account requests | Crew Identity & Airlock Control | Requires Threat Response review before provisioning. *Mehta's note: Yes, even for the nutrient synthesizer. Especially for the nutrient synthesizer. The protein cube incident started with an unreviewed service account.* |

### Spacecraft Systems Engineering

| Issue type | Route to | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Workstation hardware failure | Spacecraft Systems Engineering | If under warranty, initiate manufacturer return — good luck getting a courier at 0.3 AU |
| OS crash / system fault | Spacecraft Systems Engineering | Collect diagnostic dump before reimaging. *Mehta's note: "It just stopped working" is not a diagnostic dump.* |
| Software installation request | Spacecraft Systems Engineering | Must be on the approved software manifest. *Mehta's note: If it's not on the manifest, the answer is no. If they say "but it's free," the answer is still no. The last 'free utility' someone installed turned out to be a crypto miner from the Andromeda sector. The workstation drew more power than the propulsion array for six hours. Engineering was… concerned.* |
| ShipOS MDM enrollment | Spacecraft Systems Engineering | New crew should be auto-enrolled on arrival. If they weren't, check if they came in on the supply shuttle — those systems don't always sync. |
| Fabricator issues | Spacecraft Systems Engineering | Check if it's a networked fabricator (→ Deep Space Comms) or locally connected. *Mehta's note: The Deck 3 fabricator has been printing everything 2mm too thick since March. It's a known issue. It's always been a known issue. It will always be a known issue.* |
| Mobile module issues | Spacecraft Systems Engineering | Station-managed modules only. *Mehta's note: If the module was brought aboard personally and is not on the device manifest, Spacecraft Systems will refuse to touch it and they're right to do so. We had a crew member bring a personal quantum tablet that wasn't ShipOS-managed, and it connected to the navigation array. The trajectory plotter showed us leaving orbit for Jupiter. We were not leaving orbit for Jupiter. But for about forty-five seconds, everyone on the bridge believed we were.* |
| Slow workstation | Spacecraft Systems Engineering | Run hardware diagnostics first. In zero-g, "slow" is relative — if the crew member's workstation is literally floating away, that's Spacecraft Systems, but it's a different form. |

### Deep Space Communications

| Issue type | Route to | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Subspace relay connectivity | Deep Space Communications | Check if crew's credentials are expired first (→ Crew Identity if so). *Mehta's note: 60% of "comms down" signals are expired credentials. I have started a tally. It brings me no joy.* |
| Local comms mesh issues | Deep Space Communications | *Mehta's note: Local mesh outages affect inter-deck comms — crew can't reach each other within the station. If it's only one deck, check the repeater on that level first. If it's three decks, check whether someone rebooted the core switch again. Last time, Ensign Torres was "cleaning the compute bay" and unplugged something because "it looked like it wasn't doing anything." It was doing everything.* |
| DNS beacon failures | Deep Space Communications | *Mehta's note: DNS beacon failures are the "check if it's plugged in" of deep-space networking. Half the time it's a misconfigured beacon record. The other half, something has eaten the beacon cache. I say "something" because we have never definitively identified what, and the Exobiology team has declined to investigate on the grounds that it might be organic.* |
| Signal routing proxy requests | Deep Space Communications | Requires Threat Response approval. *Mehta's note: Proxy requests always need sign-off because external routing is how data leaves the station — intentionally or otherwise. Every 'just need to reach an external service' request gets reviewed. Most are legitimate. The one that wasn't is why Ensign Park no longer has external network privileges and why the Deck 7 atmospheric processor spent a weekend processing malware instead of air.* |
| Bandwidth / latency | Deep Space Communications | Get specific stardates and affected services. "It's been slow" is not actionable at 0.3 AU. |
| SubComm call quality | Deep Space Communications | If it's a SubComm-app-specific issue, try Mission Software Ops first. *Mehta's note: If someone's holographic projection is flickering, it's comms. If their holographic projection looks like a Cubist painting, that's software. If they don't have a holographic projection at all, check if they're in a section with atmosphere first.* |

### Mission Software Operations

| Issue type | Route to | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| FlightOS errors or access | Mission Software Operations | *Mehta's note: FlightOS is the one piece of software where 'it works on my console' is not a valid diagnostic. If FlightOS is broken, we're navigating by starlight and instinct. Neither is great at 0.3 AU.* |
| Navigation suite issues | Mission Software Operations | *Mehta's note: If navigation is wrong, escalate to P1 immediately. We are in space. "Slightly off course" is not a P3.* |
| Sensor platform calibration | Mission Software Operations | Physical hardware issues go to Spacecraft Systems Engineering. *Mehta's note: If the sensor readings look wrong, it's probably software. If the sensor is physically pointing at the wrong part of space, that's hardware. If the sensor has fallen off the hull entirely, that's Spacecraft Systems, and also a P1, and also deeply embarrassing for whoever mounted it. Check the mounting bolts. Then check them again. Space vibrations are patient and bolts are not.* |
| Mission Suite issues | Mission Software Operations | Licensing issues specifically — general Mission Suite outages are Deep Space Comms. *Mehta's note: Licensing errors usually mean someone's seat expired during a crew rotation and nobody updated the manifest. It takes four minutes to fix. It takes four hours to diagnose because nobody reads the error message — they just say 'Mission Suite is broken.' It is not broken. Your license is broken. Read the screen. The screen has words. The words have meaning.* |
| Internal tool bugs | Mission Software Operations | *Mehta's note: If it's an internal tool nobody remembers building, check who owns it first. Last time, we discovered the tool was maintained by a crew member who transferred off-station two rotations ago and the documentation was a single sticky note on a console on Deck 4 that said 'don't reboot.'* |
| Application licensing | Mission Software Operations | *Mehta's note: License audits are like asteroid showers — they come around on a schedule, everyone knows they're coming, and somehow we're still scrambling at the last minute. Check the manifest first.* |

### Threat Response Command

| Issue type | Route to | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Hostile signal received | Threat Response Command | Quarantine signal immediately in SentinelGrid. Do NOT open attachments. *Mehta's note: I cannot believe I have to write this, but do NOT open attachments from unknown vessels. Last time someone did, we spent 72 hours purging the environmental controls. The atmospheric processor on Deck 7 still smells like burnt toast and we're pretty sure it's related.* |
| Malware / suspicious activity | Threat Response Command | Isolate affected module from the network immediately. *Mehta's note: When I say 'immediately' I mean before you finish reading this sentence. Every second a compromised module stays on the network is a second the malware has to spread to systems that keep crew alive. The last incident propagated from one workstation to the environmental monitoring array in under three minutes. The array started reporting that the station had a breathable atmosphere of pure nitrogen. It did not. But nobody knew that until someone got dizzy on Deck 12. Isolate first. Investigate after.* |
| Data loss / unauthorized access | Threat Response Command | Mandatory P1 escalation. No exceptions. Not even if the Commander says it's fine. (The Commander will never say it's fine.) |
| Security certificate issues | Threat Response Command | *Mehta's note: Certificate expiration is the silent hull breach of cybersecurity. It makes no noise, gives you a 90-day warning, and then suddenly every fleet connection fails at 0300 and the Admiral is composing a memo before you've even finished your protein cube.* |
| Containment / audit requests | Threat Response Command | *Mehta's note: If the Terran Space Authority auditors are involved, treat it like a P2 minimum. The only thing scarier than a hull breach is a compliance finding. At least hull breaches are quick.* |

### Telemetry & Data Core

| Issue type | Route to | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Sensor archive access | Telemetry & Data Core | *Mehta's note: Half these requests are from researchers who forgot their data access expired three rotations ago. Check permissions first, route second.* |
| Crew file store sync issues | Telemetry & Data Core | Large dataset sync problems are common; check storage allocation limits. *Mehta's note: The Exobiology team is storing 4.7 TB of cat behavioral data. Yes, that cat. No, I don't know why.* |
| Data core access request | Telemetry & Data Core | Requires data owner approval. *Mehta's note: 'Data owner approval' sounds bureaucratic until you remember that someone once granted open access to the crew disciplinary archive and half the station found out about Commander Kapoor's early-career protein cube requisition incident. The Commander does not discuss it. We do not discuss it. The data owner approval process exists because some data, once seen, cannot be unseen. Like the Exobiology cat videos. 4.7 terabytes of them. I have seen things.* |
| Backup / restore request | Telemetry & Data Core | *Mehta's note: The last time someone tried to restore from backup without checking the timestamp, they recovered data from before the Great Fabricator Recalibration of January 2026. Three weeks of telemetry data just... vanished. Into the void. Where everything goes eventually.* |
| Legacy archive access | Telemetry & Data Core | Legacy sensor archives only; new data requests should use the standard sensor archive platform. *Mehta's note: The legacy archives run on systems from the original station build. They work. Nobody knows how. Nobody touches them. This is the arrangement.* |

## Known gaps in this guide

> **Mehta's note:** The following areas still need to be sorted out. For now, use your best judgment or escalate to me. I will sigh audibly, but I will help you. That's more than Titan Outpost's ops lead did, and look what happened to them.

- **BioAuth panel issues** — Could be Crew Identity (biometric enrollment), Threat Response (access policy enforcement), or Spacecraft Systems (panel hardware malfunction). We haven't agreed on a single owner. We've had four briefings about this. The fourth briefing was interrupted by an actual BioAuth panel failure, which was ironic and unhelpful.
- **SubComm / collaboration issues** — Is it a Deep Space Comms issue (signal quality), Mission Software Ops issue (SubComm app crash), or Spacecraft Systems issue (headset/holographic projector)? Depends on the symptoms. *Mehta's note: If you can hear them but they sound like they're underwater, that's comms. If you can see them but they're upside down, that's software. If the holodeck is on fire, that's Spacecraft Systems and also a P1.*
- **Station Core compute requests** — Station Core allocation requests, container deployments, etc. Telemetry & Data Core handles some, but we don't have a formal station infrastructure ops team yet. We've been meaning to create one since before launch.
- **Crew induction / departure** — Touches Crew Identity (accounts), Spacecraft Systems (equipment), Mission Software Ops (licenses), and Telemetry & Data Core (data access). There's a workflow for this but it's manual and breaks constantly. Last rotation, three new crew members were given airlock access before they had atmosphere privileges. They were fine. Probably.
- **Fabricator and scanning** — Networked fabricators are Deep Space Comms, local fabricators are Spacecraft Systems, scan-to-archive failures could be either. The Deck 3 fabricator is always broken. Always. It's in the orientation guide now.

## Escalation rules

Set `needs_escalation = true` when any of the following conditions apply:

1. **P1 (🔴 Red Alert) signals** — Must be acknowledged within 15 minutes. If the assigned team doesn't acknowledge, auto-escalate to Chief Signal Officer. *Mehta's note: If I get woken up at 0300 station time because your team didn't acknowledge a Red Alert, we will have a conversation. It will not be a pleasant conversation. There will be no protein cubes.*
2. **Hostile contacts** — Confirmed or suspected alien/debris threats, unidentified objects approaching the station. Even a "probably just a rock" is escalation-worthy until confirmed otherwise. *Mehta's note: The last "probably just a rock" cost us Antenna Array 7 and three months of subspace relay coverage. Escalate first, identify second.*
3. **Containment incidents** — Quarantine violations, radiation leaks, biological hazards. Always route to Threat Response Command. If it also affects another team's domain (e.g., compromised crew identity = Crew Identity + Threat Response), route to Threat Response as primary and Crew Identity as secondary. The void of space does not wait for org chart debates.
4. **Life support failures** — Oxygen, pressure, or temperature systems compromised. Even partial degradation. *Mehta's note: "Slight chill on Deck 4" turned out to be a thermal regulator cascade failure that nearly froze the entire habitation ring. If someone mentions air, heat, or pressure, assume the worst and be pleasantly surprised when it isn't.*
5. **Critical navigation** — Course deviation, collision warnings, orbital decay, trajectory anomalies. If the station might move in a direction it shouldn't, that's an escalation. *Mehta's note: We do not "wait and see" with orbital mechanics. Orbital mechanics does not wait and see with us.*
6. **Command-level signals** — Commander and section chief+ signals are auto-flagged. Treat as one priority level higher than normal assessment. Admiral+ level officers, mission command oversight, and diplomatic envoys also trigger escalation. *Mehta's note: Commander Kapoor has never once filed a signal that wasn't genuinely urgent. If you see her name, move fast.*
7. **Repeat failures** — If the same crew member has filed 3+ signals in 7 days for the same issue, or if a signal references previous unresolved signal IDs, escalate to the section chief for root cause investigation. If we've seen this before and it's still broken, Command needs to know. *Mehta's note: Exception — the atmospheric processor on Deck 7. That one's just like that. We all know. Move on.*
8. **Data breaches** — Any potential unauthorized data transmission off-station, exfiltration attempts, or anomalous outbound traffic. Route to Threat Response Command immediately. *Mehta's note: The last unauthorized transmission turned out to be Ensign Park streaming vintage Earth sports on the low-band array. The one before that was an actual hostile intelligence probe. Treat them all as the latter until proven otherwise.*
