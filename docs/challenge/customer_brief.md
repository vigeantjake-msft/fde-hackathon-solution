**From:** Commander Priya Kapoor, Mission Ops Director, Contoso Deep Space Station
**To:** Microsoft FDE Team
**Date:** March 2026
**Subject:** Help us fix our signal triage — we're drowning out here

## Who we are

Contoso Deep Space Station. ~2,000 crew orbiting at the edge of known space across 3 station sectors (Command Deck, Research Ring, Engineering Bay). We run deep space operations, scientific research, and spacecraft engineering. Heavily regulated by Interstellar Safety Command — compliance matters, system downtime can be life-threatening, and our crew does not have the patience for slow ops when they're dodging micrometeorites.

## What's broken

Our Mission Ops team handles ~180 incoming signals per day — anomaly reports, system alerts, crew requests, you name it. Right now, a human Mission Ops operator reads every signal, decides what it is, assigns a priority, and routes it to one of our 6 specialist teams. It takes **3.4 hours on average** to get a signal to the right team. That's before anyone even starts working on it. Out here, 3.4 hours can mean the difference between a minor hull patch and a catastrophic decompression event.

**42% of signals get misrouted at least once.** When a signal lands with the wrong team, they bounce it back, and we start over. Some signals take 2-3 bounces before they reach the right division. Meanwhile, Deck 7 is venting atmosphere and everyone's pointing fingers.

The worst part: our Mission Ops operators spend so much time triaging that they can't do actual resolution work. They're basically expensive human signal routers floating in zero-G.

## What we want

We want to **automate first-pass triage** for every incoming signal. Specifically:

1. **Classify** the signal into the right category — what kind of anomaly or request is this?
2. **Set priority** — how urgent is this, really? (Crew members flag "CRITICAL" on everything, including broken coffee dispensers.)
3. **Route** to the correct specialist team — get it right the first time
4. **Flag what's missing** — half our signals don't include basic info we need. We waste time pinging the reporter back over subspace to ask "which system?" or "what error code?"
5. **Give our Mission Ops team a head start on remediation** — even if a human still resolves the issue, tell them what to try first before suiting up

## Our divisions

We have 6 specialist operations teams:

| Division | What they handle |
|---|---|
| **Crew Identity & Airlock Control** | Biometric access, crew authentication, airlock provisioning, identity core sync, crew profile management |
| **Spacecraft Systems Engineering** | Hull integrity, life support systems, fabricators, consoles, structural repairs, EVA suit maintenance |
| **Deep Space Communications** | Subspace relay, comm arrays, navigation beacons, antenna alignment, inter-deck and inter-ship connectivity |
| **Mission Software Operations** | Flight planning, nav computer, science instruments, mission-critical applications, software licensing, integrations |
| **Threat Response Command** | Hostile contacts, containment breaches, spoofed transmissions, intruder detection, security protocols |
| **Telemetry & Data Core** | Data banks, sensor archives, telemetry pipelines, backup systems, data access requests |

I've attached our **internal routing guide** — but fair warning, it was written 8 months ago and some things have changed. We've reorganized divisions since the last crew rotation. About 20% of signal types aren't covered in it, and some of the routing rules overlap between teams. My team leads argue about ownership constantly. For example: who handles biometric lockouts — Crew Identity or Threat Response? Depends on whether someone fat-fingered their retinal scan or we have an actual intruder. Honestly, we're not consistent about it ourselves.

## What "good" looks like to us

- **Reduce misrouting from 42% to under 15%** in the first cycle
- **Time-to-route under 5 minutes** (from 3.4 hours)
- **Catch missing information proactively** so we stop playing subspace ping-pong with reporters three sectors away
- **Actionable remediation steps** — not generic "investigate the anomaly" but specific things an operator can actually try before escalating to EVA

If you can show me this working on even 50 of our real signals, I can make the business case to our Fleet Admiral.

## Things you should know

- Our signals come in through **4 channels**: subspace relay, holodeck comm (Teams), the bridge terminal self-service portal, and emergency beacon (transcribed by our comms center AI). Quality varies wildly. Subspace relays tend to be longer and more detailed. Holodeck comms are short and missing context. Emergency beacon transcriptions are garbled at best.
- **Some signals aren't real incidents** — we get auto-acknowledgments, "thanks" replies, crew out-of-station notifications, and occasional subspace spam from passing freighters. Our system doesn't filter these before routing.
- **We run a mix of station systems**: identity core for crew authentication, central command for device management, station suite for collaboration, and orbital compute nodes for core infrastructure. We recently deployed perimeter defense across all terminals. We still have some legacy on-station systems (navigation logistics, a few local data servers that survived the last solar flare).
- **Priority is subjective**: Crew over-escalate constantly. "CRITICAL" in the signal header usually isn't. But sometimes a quiet report like "slight vibration in docking ring 4" is actually a hull breach in progress. Context matters more than keywords out here.
- **Containment signals are special**: Anything involving potential containment breach, hostile contact, classified data exposure, or regulatory inquiry from Interstellar Safety Command must be escalated to Threat Response Command immediately, regardless of category. Getting this wrong has consequences — and at this altitude, "consequences" can mean losing your oxygen privileges.

## One more thing

I don't need a chatbot. I don't need a holographic dashboard. I need **an API I can plug into our Mission Ops workflow** that returns a JSON decision for each signal. Fast, reliable, and right most of the time. If it's not sure, it should say so — we'd rather flag uncertainty than misroute a hull breach report to the coffee machine repair queue.
