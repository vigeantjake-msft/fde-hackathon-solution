# Evaluation Results

Use this file to record the output of the local eval harness at [py/apps/eval/run_eval.py](../py/apps/eval/run_eval.py). Fill in the numbers from your latest run, then add concise analysis.

## Run Configuration

### Error Analysis

<!-- Which workflow types failed? Were failures caused by tool choice, parameters, ordering, or constraint handling? -->

## Cross-Task Takeaways

### What Improved The Score

<!-- Which changes moved the needle across multiple tasks? Better prompts, validation, retries, model changes, caching, etc. -->

### Known Limitations

<!-- Where does the system still break? Be concrete about likely failure modes per task and what you would fix next. -->
