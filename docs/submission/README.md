# Submission

## How to Submit

1. **Fork** this repo (your fork must be **public**)
2. **Build** your solution
3. **Deploy** it somewhere callable via HTTPS — not localhost, not your quarters terminal
4. **Test** with the eval harness: sample set for scoring, public eval for smoke testing
5. **Write** your three docs: `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/methodology.md`, `docs/evals.md`
6. **Create** `submission.json` at the root (see below)
7. **Push** everything
8. **Submit** at **[aka.ms/fde/hackathon](https://aka.ms/fde/hackathon)** (the hackathon platform where you register your endpoint and trigger scoring)

```

**All three docs are mandatory.** Missing one is a big hit in engineering review. Like showing up to a mission briefing without your flight plan.

Important nuance: the hidden signals are for the **0-100 functional score**. Engineering review happens separately from what is in your repo after you submit.

What we want to see is not just that you got a decent score. We want to see how you built a system: clear design, sensible model usage, attention to latency and cost, tests that cover real failure modes, and engineering choices that would hold up in front of a mission ops team.

## submission.json

Drop this at the root of your repo:

```json
{
  "participant": "your-name",
  "endpoint_url": "https://your-deployed-endpoint.example.com",
  "repository_url": "https://github.com/your-username/your-repo",
  "timestamp": "2026-03-23T00:00:00Z"
}
```

## What Gets Evaluated

| Component | Weight | How it's scored |
|---|---|---|
| **Classification accuracy** | Up to 85 pts | 5 dimensions via macro F1, ordinal credit, set F1, binary F1 |
| **Efficiency** | Up to 15 pts | Latency (p50) + cost ($/signal) from response headers |
| **Engineering review** | Separate review | Repo review of system design, code quality, tests, docs, evals, infrastructure, and production readiness |

Full scoring details: [challenge README](../challenge/README.md#how-we-score-you)

## Required Documents

See [challenge README: Engineering Review](../challenge/README.md#engineering-review) for what goes in each one.

| Document | What we want to see |
|---|---|
| `docs/architecture.md` | System design, data flow, AI pipeline, tradeoffs, what you'd change for prod |
| `docs/methodology.md` | How you approached it, what you tried, what failed, how you spent your time |
| `docs/evals.md` | Your actual numbers, which signals you got wrong and why, where your system breaks |

> **Real talk:** a clean, simple solution with honest error analysis beats a complex system with no explanation. Every single time. In space, clarity saves lives. On the leaderboard, clarity saves scores.

## Before You Submit

- [ ] `GET /health` returns HTTP 200
- [ ] `POST /triage` returns valid JSON matching the [output schema](../data/schemas/output.json)
- [ ] All 8 response fields are present: `ticket_id`, `category`, `priority`, `assigned_team`, `needs_escalation`, `missing_information`, `next_best_action`, `remediation_steps`
- [ ] `category` values are from the 8 valid anomaly categories
- [ ] `assigned_team` values are from the 7 valid response divisions (including `"None"`)
- [ ] `missing_information` values are from the 16-value constrained vocabulary
- [ ] Your API handles **10 concurrent requests** without errors or timeouts
- [ ] Each request responds in **under 30 seconds** (that's the timeout, aim for well under)
- [ ] Eval harness runs against 25 sample signals with gold scoring
- [ ] Eval harness runs against 100 public eval signals without errors or timeouts
- [ ] `submission.json` at repo root with correct endpoint URL
- [ ] `docs/architecture.md` exists and is substantive
- [ ] `docs/methodology.md` exists and is substantive
- [ ] `docs/evals.md` exists and includes actual numbers from the sample set
- [ ] Your repo is **public** on GitHub
- [ ] Your README explains how to install, run, and test your solution locally
- [ ] You've submitted at **[aka.ms/fde/hackathon](https://aka.ms/fde/hackathon)**

## Tips

- **Deploy early.** Get something live in hour 2 and iterate. The number of people who deploy at hour 23 and then panic is... nonzero.
- **Run the eval harness constantly.** It's the same scoring logic as the platform. Trust the numbers.
- **Read the mission brief.** Candidates who skip it produce noticeably worse output. The mission context matters for routing and remediation.
- **Handle the weird signals.** The hidden eval has stuff you haven't seen: vague signals, multi-issue signals, space noise. If your system 500s on a confusing signal, that's a zero on every dimension.
- **Return valid JSON even when confused.** A reasonable default beats a stack trace.
- **Explain your decisions.** "I chose X because Y" is worth more than a polished README that says nothing. We want to see how you think.
- **Send the cost headers.** It's only 5% of the score, but it signals you actually read the spec.
- **Treat the repo like part of the product.** The endpoint drives your functional score. The repo is what reviewers use to judge the engineering.
- **Show engineering judgment.** Good submissions usually have explicit timeouts, validation, useful tests, clean config, and a believable story for scale, security, and operability.
