# Dataset

Synthetic signals modeled on deep-space station operations. They're messy on purpose.

## Signal Format (Input)

Each signal has these fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ticket_id` | string | Unique ID (e.g., `SIG-4829`) |
| `subject` | string | Short summary. May be vague or misleading. |
| `description` | string | Full signal body. Quality varies wildly. |
| `reporter` | object | `{ name, email, department }` |
| `created_at` | datetime | ISO 8601 timestamp |
| `channel` | enum | `subspace_relay`, `holodeck_comm`, `bridge_terminal`, or `emergency_beacon` |
| `attachments` | string[] | Filenames mentioned (not actual files) |

See [schemas/input.json](schemas/input.json) for the formal JSON Schema.

## Triage Output Format

Your `/triage` endpoint must return **all 8 fields**:

| Field | Type | Scored? | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ticket_id` | string | — | Must match the input exactly |
| `category` | string | **Yes** (20%) | One of 8 valid categories |
| `priority` | string | **Yes** (20%) | `P1`, `P2`, `P3`, or `P4` |
| `assigned_team` | string | **Yes** (20%) | One of 7 valid teams (including `"None"`) |
| `needs_escalation` | boolean | **Yes** (10%) | `true` or `false` |
| `missing_information` | string[] | **Yes** (15%) | From the 16-value constrained vocabulary |
| `next_best_action` | string | No* | Required but not deterministically scored |
| `remediation_steps` | string[] | No* | Required but not deterministically scored |

*Remediation quality is assessed during the separate engineering review.

See [schemas/output.json](schemas/output.json) for the formal JSON Schema with all valid enum values.

## What to Expect

The signals include:

- **Clean signals**: well-written, clear, all the details you need
- **Vague signals**: "reactor offline" with zero specifics
- **Multi-issue signals**: "biometric scanner rejected me AND viewport display glitching" (good luck picking one category)
- **Hidden urgency**: no "URGENT" flag, but the body describes a life support failure
- **Missing info**: half the context you need isn't there
- **Contradictions**: subject says "low priority", body says hull integrity is compromised
- **Noise**: auto-acknowledgments, "thanks" pings, cryo-sleep notices, solar noise (these are "Not a Mission Signal", routed to "None")
- **Jargon**: dense technical language that requires actually understanding deep-space operations
- **Ambiguous routing**: is an airlock biometric issue—Crew Identity or Threat Response? Depends on the context. (Sound familiar? Read the routing guide.)

This is what real deep-space signals look like. Your system needs to handle all of it.

## Dataset Splits

| Set | Signals | Gold answers? | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Sample** | 25 | Yes | Primary development loop, score locally |
| **Public eval** | 100 | No | Pre-submission validation, checks for errors and timeouts |
| **Hidden eval** | 1000+ | No (held back) | Final scoring, includes edge cases not in public data |

> **Don't overfit.** The hidden set has signal types you won't find in the public data. Build for robustness, not memorization.
